Reverse Rosu-Havelund algorithm.
Interprets and evaluates LTL formulae over a finite trace.

The DefaultConditions class is used when there are no dynamic conditions
related to a formula.  It ignores the metadata of events that satisfied
the formula and returns them as having satisfied the dynamic conditions.
